Version **control** is an essential skill for _developers_ to master, and ~~Git~~ is by far the most popular version control system on the web. In this fast-paced course, author Ray Villalobos shows you how to install Git and use the fundamental commands you need to work with Git projects: moving files, managing logs, and working with branches.

>Plus, you'll [learn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning) how to work with the popular GitHub website to explore existing projects, clone them to your local hard drive, and use them as templates for your new projects.
